What is deIcer blog application?
******************

DeIcer blog application is a free blog built on the Spring 3.0 Java Web MVC library.


Why another blog?
*******************************

The reason why I made it was because I wanted to know the basics of the spring MVC framework, but the reason I put it here is because I want to share to others how to set up a
web application with Spring, so other more easily can get a grasp of the setup of a complete application reather thatn just from some small tutorials.
This application also has SHA-1 user password authentication.

How to install:
***************

The easiest is to deply via eclipse (with google plugin)
